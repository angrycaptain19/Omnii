# Overview

Omnii is named after the idea of Omnipotence. | *(of a deity) having unlimited power; able to do anything.*

Omnii is an ambitious project to become one of the most customizable and extensive fully hosted bot out there. I want this bot to have a place in everyone's discord server, picking up all of the bits and pieces other bots leave behind.

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia
- Economy
- Custom Commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, mod-mail, sticky roles)
- Customizable commands

# Installation

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of my bot. You can just invite the bot to your server as it stands. The source here is provided for educational purposes for discord.py, furthermore, I don't think my code should be held to a gold standard of how you should go about coding a scalable discord bot. There are many other discord bot repos on github that better suit that expectation.

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows.
  
  1. Make sure you get Python 3.6 or higher

This is required to actually run the bot.

  2. Install dependencies

This is `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

  3. Setup configuration

Create a `config.py` file in the root directory with the bot, and use the following template.

```py
client_id = "" # your bot's client ID
token = "" # your bot's token
```
