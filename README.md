# Overview

Omnii is named after the idea of Omnipotence. | *(of a deity) having unlimited power; able to do anything.*

Omnii is an ambitious project to become one of the most customizable and extensive fully hosted bot out there. I want this bot to have a place in everyone's discord server, picking up all of the bits and pieces other bots leave behind.

- Moderation features (kick/ban/softban, mod-log, filter, chat cleanup)
- Trivia
- Economy
- Custom Commands
- Imgur/gif search
- Admin automation (self-role assignment, mod-mail, sticky roles)
- Customizable commands
